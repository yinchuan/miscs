systemd基本用法
From: arch linux wiki

nalyzing the system state
    List running units:
        $ systemctl
        $ systemctl list-units
    List failed units:
        $ systemctl --failed
    The available unit files can be seen in
        /usr/lib/systemd/system/ and
        /etc/systemd/system/ (the latter takes precedence).
    You can see list installed unit files by:
        $ systemctl list-unit-files

Using units
    Units can be, for example,
        services (.service),
        mount points (.mount),
        devices (.device) or
        sockets (.socket).
    When using systemctl, you generally have to specify the complete name of the unit file, including its suffix, for example sshd.socket.
    There are however a few shortforms when specifying the unit in the following systemctl commands:
        1. If you don't specify the suffix, systemctl will assume .service. For example, netcfg and netcfg.service are treated equivalent.
        2. Mount points will automatically be translated into the appropriate .mount unit. For example, specifying /home is equivalent to home.mount.
        3. Similiar to mount points, devices are automatically translated into the appropriate .device unit, therefore specifying /dev/sda2 is equivalent to dev-sda2.device.
        See man systemd.unit for details.
    Activate a unit immediately:
        # systemctl start <unit>
    Deactivate a unit immediately:
        # systemctl stop <unit>
    Restart a unit:
        # systemctl restart <unit>
    Ask a unit to reload its configuration:
        # systemctl reload <unit>
    Show the status of a unit, including whether it is running or not:
        $ systemctl status <unit>
    Check whether a unit is already enabled or not:
        $ systemctl is-enabled <unit>
    Enable a unit to be started on bootup:
        # systemctl enable <unit>
    Disable a unit to not start during bootup:
        # systemctl disable <unit>
    Show the manual page associated with a unit (this has to be supported by the unit file):
        $ systemctl help <unit>
    Reload systemd, scanning for new or changed units:
        # systemctl daemon-reload

Power management
    Shut down and reboot the system:
        $ systemctl reboot
    Shut down and power-off the system:
        $ systemctl poweroff
    Suspend the system:
        $ systemctl suspend
    Put the system into hibernation:
        $ systemctl hibernate
    Put the system into hybrid-sleep state (or suspend-to-both):
        $ systemctl hybrid-sleep

Running DEs under systemd
    systemctl enable gdm
    systemctl start gdm
设置/etc/rc.local脚本
systemd中有rc-local.service支持rc.local
1. vi /etc/rc.d/rc.local
rc.local是一个bash脚本，所以第一行应该是 #!/bin/bash
2. ln -s /etc/rc.d/rc.local /etc/rc.local
3. systemctl enable rc-local.service
